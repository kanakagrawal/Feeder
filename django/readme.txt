In the PS we were asked to make a repo 'project' having 3 repo's. Initially we made different repo's in our bitbucket. Now when trying to make a project repo and copying all of 'lab10' repo inside a repository in it, the commits of lab10 will get lost. Therefore we are providing link for 'lab10' repo.
We have used bitbucket. The repository name is 'lab10' under 'kanak15140' username.
link: https://kanak15140@bitbucket.org/kanak15140/lab10.git
The Commit id for submission is : e93e262
Commit Message : Lab10 Submission Commit

Also, as mentioned on piazza we are not submitting the source files on moodle.

admin site:
	locolhost_link/feeder/admin		(eg: http://127.0.0.1:8000/feeder/admin/)

admin credential:
	username = admin
	password = admin

About Add course:
	1) If a course with same course code already exists then it is not allowed.
	2) During adding course admin has been given power to select instructors for the course.(For this it has to select from the list of instructors already registered in the software. Therefore to assign an instructor a course he/she must first create an id for him/herself from the http://127.0.0.1:8000/feeder/register link.). We have added this feature so that the TA's and profs can be assigned to course and they can do stuff(feedback/deadline, etc.) related to their course only.
	3) To enroll students to course a csv file has to be uploaded in form with required details in required format.(Here we are checking whether it is a csv file or not.)
About view course:
	1) Admin has been given power to delete course from the view courses.
	2) It the instructor column it shows all instructor one after the other.

Citation:
	Syle for admin login was coppied from internet. We copied from internet because we have already created a login in for instructor. So to make it look more good we have copied a good style from internet. We think there should be no problem with this as for marking purposes one can always refer to the style for instructor login (link: http://127.0.0.1:8000/feeder/login)

We have cleared the database and add some instructors (cse iitb profs with username and password as their as there cse username) and some courses.
Also there is a students.csv file with student list.

Also, we are storing email id's of instructors and students alongside username so that a functionality such as to send mail to student can be added in future

Before closing the window admin should make sure to logout else he would be logged in he opens next time.(We will try to improve this feature before final project submission)

Relfection Essay:
	As discussed in piazza reflection essay and latex pdf will be submitted by 5th November.
